# Caesar Cipher

## This program will take a string inputted by the user, then either encrypt or decrypt it.

- The basic logic is present for the encryption side of things.
- Decryption however has not been implemented just yet.
- The code isn't bulletproof yet, so a handful of inputs can break it.
- The program in it's current state needs to be restarted each time, where in the future I would like it to be robust.
