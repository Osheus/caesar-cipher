# Caesar Cipher

## This program will take a string inputted by the user, then either encrypt or decrypt it.

- Encryption works!
- Most inputs shouldn't break it now!

### To Do:
- The program in it's current state needs to be restarted each time, where in the future I would like it to be robust.
- Decryption however has not been implemented just yet.
